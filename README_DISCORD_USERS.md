# How to Use the Shit Tracker Bot in Discord

Welcome! This guide is for regular Discord users in servers where the Shit Tracker Bot is active.

## What Does the Bot Do?
- The bot helps keep conversations respectful.
- If you see a message that could be improved, react to it with ðŸ’©.
- The bot will log the message and suggest a more respectful version using AI.

## How to Flag a Message
1. **React with ðŸ’©** to any message you think is inappropriate or could be improved.
2. The bot will post a log in the server's moderation/log channel.
3. The log will include:
   - The original message
   - The author and the person who flagged it
   - A suggested, improved version of the message

## Example
**Original Message:**
> "This is stupid and you're an idiot"

**AI-Improved Version:**
> "I disagree with this approach and would like to discuss alternative solutions."

## Why Use This?
- It helps keep the community positive and constructive.
- Moderators can use the AI suggestions to guide conversations.

## FAQ
- **Will the bot punish users?**
  - No, the bot only suggests improvements. Moderators decide what to do next.
- **Can I see the improved message?**
  - Yes! The improved version is posted in the log channel for moderators (and sometimes users) to see.
- **Is my data safe?**
  - The bot only uses messages for improvement suggestions and does not store them permanently.

## Need Help?
- If you have questions, ask a server moderator.
- For technical issues, let a moderator know so they can contact the bot admin.
